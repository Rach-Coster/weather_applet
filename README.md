# weather_applet
A weather applet I made for Free Code Camp. 

It utilises three different Apis for geolocation, location and weather. Here is a link to the codepen version: https://codepen.io/rach-coster/full/gXgJEz/

### Changes 
I am pretty happy with it overall but would like to try implimenting a hash table for the different weather types. Overall, nothing too funky going on with it.
